HTP - Hack The Planet
===

web based overlays of the "viruses" seen in the movie hackers. These are just for fun and are not actual viruses.

End goal is to intergrate this into my home wireless network as a randomly injected frame (Different project that will eventually be linked here)

Examples of some of the overlays I want to make can be found here:

Currently I am trying to contact the holder of the movie rights to see if we can use some of the actual clips from the movie in this project.

Overlays left to make still:

Cookie - Cookie monster esk overlay that says "I want a cookie. Give me a cookie, NOW!" with the "O" in NOW being the cookie monster esk character. After that is displayed it the cookie monster esk charcter should go across the screen leaving a trail of "cookie" followed by a picture of a cookie until the screen fills up. If possible I would like to have it go away after a user types "cookie"

Zero Bug - A 3D Sphere that looks kinda like Pacman that "eats" up elements on the page.

Rabbit - Pattern of red and black rabbit images overlayed over the page. Perhaps add some icon to send a "flu shot" to get rid of it.

Davinchi - Audio clip of "Row row row your boat" a face with a "difference" like affect applied and some form of a ship wireframe with what appears to be information about the ship.
